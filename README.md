==========

Problem:
Given 2, 3, 4 dimensional space, randomly select V vertices uniformly from each axis. Create a complete undirected graph by letting each edge weight be the distance between the two vertices that connect it.  For V <= 65536, calculate the average edge weight of the complete graph's minimal spanning tree.
